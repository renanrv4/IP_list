# üíª Introduction to Programming using Python
This is my repository dedicated to the activities related to the basics of the programming in Python. Here I will document all the exercises that I did for the Introduction to Programming subject. 

# üóÇÔ∏è Folders
The activities are divided by folders, where each of them represents a different topic of the basics of programming within Python, such as loops, lists, and others.

- # Initial List
  [Initial List](https://github.com/renanrv4/IP_list/tree/main/initial_list) -
 This list contains the basics estructures of python.
These first exercises helped me getting acquainted with writing codes in Python.

- # Conditional Commands List
  [Conditionals Exercises](https://github.com/renanrv4/IP_list/tree/main/List1) -
  The activities of this list had the objective to teach conditional statements in different situations.

- # Loops of Repetition List
  [Loops Exercises](https://github.com/renanrv4/IP_list/tree/main/List2) -
  In this list, I learned how to use repetition in addition to the knowledge acquired with the conditional exercises.

- # List Data Structure Exercises
  [List Exercises](https://github.com/renanrv4/IP_list/tree/main/List3) -
  With this list I learned about a new form of saving variables and information in Python. Using this Data Structure with Repetition and Conditional statements allowed me to write code structures cleaner than I had before.

- # Functions List
  [Functions Exercises](https://github.com/renanrv4/IP_list/tree/main/List4) -
 In this list, I learned to modularize pieces of code, with this, the main code would be written in separately from the functionalities.

- # Recursion List
  [Recursion Exercises](https://github.com/renanrv4/IP_list/tree/main/List5) -
  The activities of this list involved the use of functions while using recursion (function calling itself) to solve problems. On this list, there was a special exercise that I had more difficulty with.
  This exercise involved the use of recursion to simulate a tree of decisions, but with time I learned how to use recursion to make this kind of structure.

- # Tuples and Dictionary List
  [Tuples and Dictionary Exercises](https://github.com/renanrv4/IP_list/tree/main/List6)
  In the last activities, I learned a new form of saving informations, with Dictionaries, and Tuples.
